# 2D-Platformer-Game-Engine

This is a simple 2D Platformer game engine I had developed using Pygame in Python. The bricks in the level are generated using the 2D matrix in the 'main.py' module. In order to render a block, replace 0 with 1 in the matrix. The player is able to jump, move ahead, backward. The camera also scrolls along as the player moves.
